# PRD: landing-page-gen

## Problem

A landing page needs a dozen or more visuals that read as one campaign and
match how Picsart already presents itself. Producing them by hand, one
generation at a time, does not scale and loses the reasoning behind each
asset.

## Input

`runs/<run>/skeleton.md`: page frontmatter (brand, audience, defaults,
budget, notes), one H2 per section with all text and a `slot` block per
media node, annotations as blockquotes. Produced by `lp-corpus skeleton`,
edited by hand.

## Output

`runs/<run>/dist/index.html` with every `creative` and `thumbnail` slot
filled by a worker's accepted workflow result; `report.md` listing per slot
the workflow, credits quoted vs spent, review rounds and verdict; a complete
`workflow.yaml` and `result.md` per section.

## What "satisfactory" means

The rubric lives in the `picsart-workflows` skill (`evaluation.md`). Rules
below are lessons that reviews teach; each adds one line with the run that
taught it.

- Still-to-motion whose motion reshapes or reframes the picture needs a still
  with visible edges and margin (a print on a plain backdrop), not a
  full-bleed scene; a full-bleed still gives the video model nothing to move.
  (runs/dry-1 S01, review 1)
- Every video step states `generateAudio: false`, `async: true` and ends its
  prompt with ", no text or logos"; the reviewer checks the yaml, not the
  intent. (runs/dry-1 S01, review 1)
- A worker's "examples share finish X" claim must hold for every example it
  names; say which examples differ. (runs/dry-1 S01, review 1)
- Anything the call must carry (`async: true`, `generateAudio: false`) lives
  in the step's `params`, never only in its `note`; `params` is what is sent.
  (runs/dry-1 S01, review 2)

## Non-goals

- Writing or rewriting page copy.
- Generating product UI screenshots, icons or decorative brand assets.
- Producing the production Next.js page; the output is a snapshot.

## Budget

Default run cap 300 credits, enforced by hook. Per-slot caps are advisory
(image 20, video 60) and reviewed against the ledger.
