# PRD: landing-page-gen

## Problem

A landing page needs a dozen or more visuals that read as one campaign and
match how Picsart already presents itself. Producing them by hand, one
generation at a time, does not scale and loses the reasoning behind each
asset.

## Input

`runs/<run>/skeleton.md`: page frontmatter (brand, audience, defaults,
budget, notes), one H2 per section with all text and a `slot` block per
media node, annotations as blockquotes. Produced by `lp-corpus skeleton`,
edited by hand.

## Output

`runs/<run>/dist/index.html` with every `creative` and `thumbnail` slot
filled by a worker's accepted workflow result; `report.md` listing per slot
the workflow, credits quoted vs spent, review rounds and verdict; a complete
`workflow.yaml` and `result.md` per section.

## What "satisfactory" means

The rubric lives in the `picsart-workflows` skill (`evaluation.md`). Rules
below are lessons that reviews teach; each adds one line with the run that
taught it. Starts empty.

## Non-goals

- Writing or rewriting page copy.
- Generating product UI screenshots, icons or decorative brand assets.
- Producing the production Next.js page; the output is a snapshot.

## Budget

Default run cap 300 credits, enforced by hook. Per-slot caps are advisory
(image 20, video 60) and reviewed against the ledger.
